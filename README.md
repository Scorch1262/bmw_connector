# BMW Connector

IN DEVELOPMENT

Using a modified version of [bimmer_connected](https://github.com/bimmerconnected/bimmer_connected/), the [test.py](./test.py)-script fetches a lot of useful data including images of all cars from the BMW server and presents them to the user in the command line.

Before using, copy `bmwcredentials.py.txt` to `bmwcredentials.py` and add your BMW username and password.
